5. Record your node ID.
6. Execute the above one-click install command on your VPS, it will install fully automatically and you will be prompted to enter your node ID.

## Caution
Since your repository may be public after you Fork this repository. Modifying the configuration file directly may expose your panel's key information. We recommend downloading `config.yml` and uploading it to your own server after modifying the information. And fill in the `install.sh` with your own config file download link. Finally, upload `install.sh` to your own server to generate your own one-click installation command.
